# Rules.
100 votes to the winner of the auction. (Max bet)
everyone bet has to pay the bet amount (eg Person A: 10 , Person B: 15 == Person B gets 100 (-15) + Person A has to Pay 10)
no one knows who bet what. 
u can stop playing but then Game Over for you.
100 is the price
u can bet everything (even 1)
u can "override" your last bet
u only have to pay your highest bet.
